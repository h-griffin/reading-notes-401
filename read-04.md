- [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)
classes hold values for objects that can be assigned to multiple things

- [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
  - Optional: Naive Recursion is Naive section and beyond
iterattive algoriths go one at a time, like itterating through an array, one by one for each thing, a recursive alogrithm divides its itterations byy calling itself inside its own fuction. giving the funtion multiple things to do and calling it more than once will run much more code faster than calling each one individually.
