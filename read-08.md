- [List Comprehensions](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python)
a new way of interacting with lists, ratehr than 
```for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression```
you can use this 
```[expression for item in list if conditional]```
this does exactly the same thing, but on one line. it is formated a little backwards, but you can assign it to a new variable and the result will be stored in teh variable, saving space.
