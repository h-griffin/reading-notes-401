- [Linked Lists](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)
a linked list holds a reference to the next node, a slightly linked list contains only one link, doubly has a reference to the next and previous. nodes are the items containing the link in the list. you can loop thorugh these using the next reference of the nodes called transversing, it is best to use a while loop to keep checking if there is a next linked.
