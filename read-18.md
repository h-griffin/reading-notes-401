- [Ceasar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
the ceasar cipher was named afte julias ceasar who used it during the roman era, using shifst. 
the ceasar cipher is a default of 3 shifts, however can be reffered to as a cipher that uses shifts as its key. to encrypt the plain text it shifts the letters or numbers by an agreed upon shift ammount or key. to decrypt the message you must know the correct shift value or key.

one tsrategy to breaking ciphers is to look at th eletter E is the most common characters in the english alphabet, which means that the most comon character in the cipher text is most likely to be th eletter E. with this you can count how many letters away it is an dapply to the rest of the text.

one way funtions are easy to encrypt but difficult to encrypt. like mixing paint. for examply ther ewould be a base paint that both parties have, jane would add her color the the base and send it to john, john would ad his color to the paint that has the base and jane, and jane does the same. now both parties have a paint color with all 3 colors without giving away too much information.

diffie-hellman - take one number to **the base,** to the power of another number **the exponent.** take the remainder when dividing by a third number **the modulus,**

- 3^5 modulo 31
    - 3^5 = 243
- 243 mod 31
    - 243 รท 31 = 26
 
i used 3 to power of __ and got 31
you test for what exponent gives 31

using numbers that are hundreds of digits long makes this nearly impossible
