- [Read: Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)



there are many different kinds of graphs, there is a directed graph, means that the vertices/nodes have one way direction connections/edges, and an undirected graph has two way connection/edges. a complete graph, each vertex/node has a connection to every other vetex/node in the graph.

a connected graph has connections between multiple nodes, but not all, and some nodes may have more connections than others. a disconnected graph is where some vertices may not have any edges at all. 

a cyclic graph is a directed graph with a cycle, the start point can be reached agian through the one way connection/edges. an acyclic graph is a directed graph that cannot return to the start point. 

graphs may be represented in an adjacency list where it draws out all of the vertexes and edges showing th eneighbors/edges, or in a adjacency matrix, which is like a grid with all of the nodes on the side and bottom and you can find in the graph if the two nodes have 0 or 1 connection aka if they are connected or not.

a weighted graph has edges that weigh more than others, and in a matrix rather than 1 or 0 it is 0-highest weight. 

you can traverse these like trees.
