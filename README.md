## read-07
- NOTE This is a long reading. The portion to make sure you cover is on global and nonlocal keywords. You can skim the rest.
- [Python Scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)
- NOTE* The repeated Big O content is intentional. This is a big concept and worth hearing about from multiple presenters. TIP: watch on faster speed if you like.
