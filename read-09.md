- [Statistics - Probability](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/)
an example of probability statistics would be a coin toss, with a smaller range of tests the probability seem sskewed, however the larger the test size, the results even out to a more true average result. when looknig at graphs of distribution when there is overlap the examplesare most likely from the same distribution, rather than when the graphs no not touch or overlap, which means they are different distributions. given a normal distribuiton, there are three different average distances of the mean, this is the three sigma rule(68-95-99). this means that 68% of the results will fall into one standard deviation of hte mean, 95 will fall into two, and 99.7 will fall into all three. the Zscore is an equation to show how many standard deviations a given data point is from the mean.
